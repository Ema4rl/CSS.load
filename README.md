# CSS.load
A brilliant library for asynchronously loading CSS and executing callbacks via a cross-browser compatible promise API.

Inspired by: [loadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS),
[css-onload.js](https://gist.github.com/pete-otaqui/3912307), and
[Only.js](http://ema4rl.github.io/Only.js).
